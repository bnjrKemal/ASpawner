The plugin allows a player to convert any item they are holding into a selected spawner type. The process is initiated using the **/aspawner** command, and the player must have Operator (OP) permissions to use this command.

After this process, the obtained spawner carries the characteristics of a Vanilla Minecraft spawner. This means that you can customize and manage the behavior of this special spawner, similar to the original Minecraft spawner.

In summary, this plugin provides players with the ability to transform items they are holding into a spawner, allowing them to customize and use the functionality of a Vanilla Minecraft spawner.
